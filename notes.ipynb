    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "We try to learn from a **training dataset** that we assume is \"correct\" the parameters for best classification or regression. \n",
    "For that, the algorithm will take into account the combination of variables that are fed.\n",
    "The way in which the features are mathematically processed depends on the kernel function of the ML algorithm.\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Conversely, if the dataset is unlabeled, we try to find structure within the data. For example, clustering algorithms.\n",
